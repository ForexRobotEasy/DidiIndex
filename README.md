# DidiIndex.mq5 ReadMe File

## Description
This code is a custom indicator called DidiIndex.mq5. It is developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team and can be used for analyzing and identifying potential buy and sell points in the market based on simple moving averages.

The indicator calculates three moving averages: fast, normalized, and slow. It then looks for a specific pattern called 'Agulhada' where all three moving averages are equal. If the pattern is detected, the indicator further analyzes the data to determine if it is a Spider Woman's Kiss pattern or a Buy Needle/Sell Needle pattern. Based on the analysis, it marks potential buy or sell points on the chart.

## Indicator Parameters
- FAST_PERIOD: Period for the fast moving average (default: 3)
- NORMALIZED_PERIOD: Period for the normalized moving average (default: 8)
- SLOW_PERIOD: Period for the slow moving average (default: 20)

## Indicator Buffers
The indicator uses two buffers to mark potential buy and sell points on the chart:
- BuyBuffer: Stores the potential buy points
- SellBuffer: Stores the potential sell points

## Initialization Function
The OnInit() function is responsible for initializing the indicator. It sets up the indicator buffers and labels.

## Calculation Function
The OnCalculate() function is the main calculation function of the indicator. It receives the price data and iterates over the data points to calculate the moving averages and detect the Agulhada pattern. It also calls the IsSpiderWomansKiss() function to perform additional analysis for the Spider Woman's Kiss pattern.

## Additional Functions
- IsSpiderWomansKiss(): This function checks if the given moving averages form a Spider Woman's Kiss pattern. Additional analysis logic can be added to this function.
